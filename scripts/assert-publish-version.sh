# assert-publish-version.sh — shared publish-workflow version guard.
#
# Ported from canopy scripts/assert-publish-version.sh (FOR-365 C3 pattern),
# adapted to this repo's bun toolchain: package.json is read with
# `bun --print` instead of node, so the guard runs anywhere the repo's
# pinned bun is on PATH. The registry lookup still uses npm (the publish
# client the workflows pin).
#
# Two modes, selected by GITHUB_REF:
#
#   Tag build (refs/tags/<tag-prefix>-v*):
#     Assert the version named by the tag equals the package's package.json
#     version, so a tag can never publish a version other than the one it
#     names. Runs before build/publish so a mismatch fails fast.
#
#   Dispatch build (anything else — workflow_dispatch recovery path):
#     Assert the package.json version is NOT already on the registry
#     (`npm view <name>@<version>` must 404), so a recovery dispatch can only
#     publish a version that has never shipped.
#
# Usage: assert-publish-version.sh <package-dir> <tag-prefix>
#   e.g. assert-publish-version.sh packages/cli-kit cli-kit
#
# Requires bun (to read package.json) and npm (registry lookup) on PATH.
